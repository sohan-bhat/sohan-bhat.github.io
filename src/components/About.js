                            I'm 15 studying as a  sophomore at Heritage High School in Frisco, TX.

                            I build ML systems from scratch to understand what's under the frameworks.
                            Most recently: SignNet, a convolutional neural network written entirely in
                            NumPy (no PyTorch, no autograd) that classifies German traffic signs at 90%
                            accuracy, with a live browser demo. Before that, a scalar autograd engine.
                            That work led to a research paper on detecting silent training failures,
                            born from a bug in SignNet that lost me weeks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I program for FRC Team 2714 in Java, heading into the season focused on
                            vision and autonomous. I'm also training for USACO Gold in C++.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Outside of that, I have a hobby in soccer and tennis while also loving to spend time hiking with my family.

                            The network trains, the loss falls, and the model is still wrong.
                            A study of how these failures slip through unnoticed and how to
                            catch them early.
